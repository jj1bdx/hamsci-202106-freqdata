Notes on frequency result measurement offset

After the June 2021 Eclipse Festival, I've measured the reception frequency
offset of Airspy HF+ Discovery for the measurement set to 9999kHz USB with Leo
Bodnar Mini GPSDO set to 25MHz and airspy-fmradion 20210427-0 offset
measurement function of FM broadcasting. My experience suggests that the clock
frequency of Airspy HF+ Discovery has a negative coefficient to the
environmental temperature, and the offset range will drift up to +-0.2ppm.

After running the experiment for 30 minutes from 0015UTC to 0045UTC
13-JUN-2021, the frequency offset of the Airspy HF+ Discovery clock was
measured was -0.083ppm from the GPSDO reference.  This result suggests that
the audio frequency of JJ1BDX's 9999kHz reception results was actually shifted
0.83Hz up, i.e., true 1000Hz sound was measured as 1000.83Hz.
